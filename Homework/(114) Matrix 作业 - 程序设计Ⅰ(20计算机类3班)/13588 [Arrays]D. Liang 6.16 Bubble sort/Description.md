Time Limit: 1sec Memory Limit:256MB  -->
# Description
Write a sort function that uses the bubble-sort algorithm. 
The bubble-sort algorithm makes several passes through the array. On each pass, successive neighboring pairs are compared. If a pair is in decreasing order, its values are swapped; otherwise, the values remain unchanged. The technique is called a bubble sort or sinking sort because the smaller values gradually "bubble" their way to the top and the larger values sink to the bottom.
```
void bubbleSort(double list[], int size)
```
# Hint
You should submit the implementation of the function but do not submit the main() function.
