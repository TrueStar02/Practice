# [Pointers and C-String]D. Liang 7.7 Checking palindrome

#Description
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The word "mom," "dad," and "moon," for example, are all palindromes. Write a function to check whether a string is a palindrome, ignore case. For example, "Mom" is a palindrome when we ignore case.
The function header is:

```
int isPalindrome(const char * const s)
```
#Hint
Don't submit the main() function.
