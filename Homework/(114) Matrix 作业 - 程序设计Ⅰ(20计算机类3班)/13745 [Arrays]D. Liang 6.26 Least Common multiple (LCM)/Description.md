# [Arrays]D. Liang 6.26 Least Common multiple (LCM)

## Description
Write a program that reads in two integers and finds their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. For example, the LCM for 8 and 12 is 24, for 15 and 25 is 75, and for 120 and 2 is 120. 
## Input
The first line is a positive integer t for the number of test cases.
Each test case contains one line with two positive integers n1 and n2.
0<n1<100000, 0<n2<100000.
## Output
For each test case, output "test case #testcaseNum:" in first line, then output another line with the format:
n1 n2 LCM
