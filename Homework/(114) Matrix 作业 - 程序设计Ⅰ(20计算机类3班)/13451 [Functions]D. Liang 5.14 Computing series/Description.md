# [Functions]D. Liang 5.14 Computing series

# Description
The value of $\pi$ can be approximately estimated using the following formula:

m(n) = 4 * (1 - $\frac{1}{3}$ + $\frac{1}{5}$ -  $\frac{1}{7}$ + $\frac{1}{9}$ - $\frac{1}{11}$ +  â€¦ + $\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n + 1}$)

# Input
```
A positive integer n (1 <= n <= 10000)
```
# Output
```
The series computing by n
(The precision of series should be fixed to 5)
```
# Sample Input
```
10
```
# Sample Output
```
