# [Loops]D. Liang 4.11 Finding numbers divisible by 5 or 6, but not both

# Description
Write a program that reads two integer a and b(a<b), and displays all the numbers from a to b, ten numbers per line, which are divisible by 5 or 6, but not both.
 
## Input
Two integer a and b (20<=a<b<500).
## Output
You should specify the width of each number's print field to 5, and justify the output to the left.

The numbers in one line are separated by a space and there is no space at the end of the line.
## Sample Input
```
100 162
```
## Sample Output
```
100   102   105   108   110   114   115   125   126   130
132   135   138   140   144   145   155   156   160   162
