# Simple Decoding


# Description

Some text that consists of "a" - "z", "A" - "Z" and " " has been encoded into a series of numbers according to the following rules:

```
" " -> 000
"a" -> 001
"b" -> 002
"c" -> 003
...
"y" -> 025
"z" -> 026

"A" -> 101
"B" -> 102
"C" -> 103
...
"Y" -> 125
"Z" -> 126

```

You are supposed to decode the series of numbers and show the original text.
